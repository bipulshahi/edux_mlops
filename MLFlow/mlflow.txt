# What is mlflow ?

* mlflow is a open source platform designed to manage the machine learning lifecycle

1. Experiment Tracking - Logging parameters, metrics and models.
2. Model Registry - Storing and manage different versions of models.
3. Project Packaging - Organizing ML code into reproducible formats.
4. Model Deployment - Serving models in production environments.

# create a virtual environment

#install minconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download/success#miniconda

conda create --name mlflow_env python=3.11 -y

#Acivate virtual environment

conda acivate mlflow_env

#install mlflow

pip install mlflow
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy scipy


'mlflow.set_tracking_uri()' - connects to a tracking uri.

'mlflow.get_tracking_uri()' - returns the current tracking uri

'mlfow.create_experiment()' - creates a new experiment and returns its id

'mlfow.set_experiment()' - sets an experiment as active. If an experiment is not existing then it will create a new experiment.

'mlflow.start_run()' - returns the currently active run(if one exists), or starts a new run

'mlflow.end_run()' - ends the current run

'mlflow.log_param()' - logs the parameter used during a run

'mlflow.log_metrics()' - logs the metric created during a ml experiment

'mlflow.log_artifact()' - logs the artifacts generated during a ml experiment
